# TODO LIST
Here is a list of things we will do but not just right now, so we're writing it down here.

## Feature reliability
This is about working functionalities which we need to make sure they're reliable for more complex cases

* Naming Strategies
	* We should print current strategy for each file
	* We should try to modify a file only if it hasn't the correct strategy
	* We should print a message about if we modify the file or not

## Unit Tests

* Naming strategies
	* Test existence of files with wrong naming strategies
	* Test if their current naming strategies is the wrong one
	* Test if their naming strategies was correctly modified
